# HED Score

**Hiremath Early Detection (HED) Score** — a measure-theoretic metric for evaluating early detection in time-series anomaly and regime-change tasks.

## What is the HED Score?

HED quantifies **how early** a detector raises its probability mass after a regime shift.
It integrates the baseline-corrected posterior probability stream through an exponential decay kernel:

```
HED(P, t*, λ) = Σ_{t=t*}^{T-1}  (P(t) − B) · exp(−λ (t − t*))
```

where:
- `P(t)` — posterior probability of the anomalous regime at time `t`
- `t*`   — true onset of the regime shift
- `B`    — mean of `P` before `t*` (baseline correction)
- `λ`    — Hiremath Decay Constant: controls how steeply late detections are penalised

The resulting scalar simultaneously encodes **detection acuity**, **temporal lead**, and **pre-transition calibration quality**.

## Why does AUC fail?

AUC is **temporally agnostic**: it assigns identical credit to a detection at `t*+1` and a detection at `t*+100`.  Two detectors with identical AUC can have radically different behaviour — one fires immediately after the shift; the other fires 50 steps later.  In time-critical domains (cyber-physical security, epidemic monitoring, financial surveillance), this distinction is everything.

**HED resolves this** by exponentially discounting detections that occur late after the shift.

```
                 AUC      HED
Fast detector    0.92     0.87   ← rewards early rise
Ramp detector    0.90     0.51   ← penalises slow ramp
Delayed detector 0.91     0.23   ← penalises 40-step lag
```

Same AUC. Very different temporal quality.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hed-score
```

With experiment dependencies:

```bash
pip install "hed-score[experiments]"
```

## Quick example

```python
import numpy as np
from hed import hed_score

T      = 200    # total time steps
t_star = 100    # regime shift begins here
lam    = 0.1    # Hiremath Decay Constant

# A fast detector (jumps to 0.9 immediately)
P_fast = np.zeros(T)
P_fast[t_star:] = 0.9

# A slow detector (ramps up over 100 steps)
P_slow = np.zeros(T)
P_slow[t_star:] = np.linspace(0, 0.9, T - t_star)

print(hed_score(P_fast, t_star, lam=lam))   # → ~0.87
print(hed_score(P_slow, t_star, lam=lam))   # → ~0.45
```

Any model that outputs a probability stream can be evaluated:

```python
from hed import hed_score
from hed.metrics import auc_score, hed_far_curve

# Your model's output
P = your_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Evaluate
hed = hed_score(P, t_star=known_onset, lam=0.1)
auc = auc_score(P, labels)
print(f"HED={hed:.4f}  AUC={auc:.4f}")

# FAR–HED curve
far, hed_vals = hed_far_curve(P, t_star=known_onset, lam=0.1)
```

## Hiremath Standard Table

| Domain | Recommended λ | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Cyber-physical security | 0.3 | Every second of early warning is critical |
| Epidemiological monitoring | 0.05 | Slower-moving outbreaks, longer horizon |
| Algorithmic surveillance | 0.2 | Market movements can be rapid |
| General / exploratory | 0.1 | Balanced default |

## Key properties

The HED Score satisfies three axiomatic requirements (proved in the paper):

- **A1 Temporal Monotonicity** — detecting earlier always yields a higher score.
- **A2 Invariance to Pre-Attack Bias** — the score is unaffected by a detector's systematic false-alarm rate before the shift.
- **A3 Sensitivity Decomposability** — the score factors cleanly into acuity × lead × calibration components.
